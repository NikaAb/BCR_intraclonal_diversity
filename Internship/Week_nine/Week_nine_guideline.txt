Visualize the repertoire containing 520 clones
    
    - How to integrate all the clones in the image? maybe a threshold for grouping low abundance clones?

Steps : 
1) calculate the size of each clone
2) apply the threshold
    - visualize the x more abundant clones
    - visualize the clones with more than y% of abundance as a separate circle, all the clones less abundant than y%, are grouped and shown as a single circle called "polyclonal background".
3) Groupe clonotypes within each clone: same V gene and allele + same J gene + same CDR3 (AA)
4) run the visualization program

Intraclonal diversity study 
- How much time does it take to infer the tree?
- How to calculate the consensus sequences? the most abundant? the text consensus? 

Steps for each clone :

1) find the clonotypes and abundances 
2) create the consensus sequence representing the clonotype (use the fasta file)
2) run GCtree on consensus sequences
3) visualize the tree
