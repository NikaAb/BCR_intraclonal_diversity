Step one input :
		- Fasta file [text file]
		- IMGT annotation output "" [text file]
		- IMGT annotation output "" [text file]
Run step one :
		> SCOPer for having the clones [R]
		> Regrouping the sequence based on IMGT clonetype (AA) definition [python]
		> Format the outputs to Repertoire_two_levels_info [python] (see repertoire_formatted.txt)
Step one output :
		~ Circle packing visualization + clone and clonotype percentage 

Step two input :
		- User Email adress 
		- List of clones to analyse [choose by user via website]
		- Repertoire_two_levels_info [text file]
		- Fasta file [text file]
		- IMGT annotation output "" [text file]
Run step two :
		For each clone :
			> Find the germline seq [python]
			> Find the consensus seq for each clonotype [python]
			> Align the consesnsus seqs + the gemline seq ===> keep also the distances [python]
			> Find the gene limite positions on each consensus seq [python]
			> Run the GCtree [python]
Step two output :
		For each clone :
			~ GCtree
			~ Distance plot between two or multiple seqs
			~ seq alignement with V, D and J gene limites on each seq
