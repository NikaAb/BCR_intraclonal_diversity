An overview of the human immune diversity

B cells realize the antibody-mediated response of the adaptive immune system a . These cells recognize and
interact with the antigens b through Immunoglobulin molecule of the B-cell Receptor (BCR-IG). The BCR
consists of two types of components: the recognition unit, structured by a membrane Immunoglobulin (IG)
protein, and the transmembrane signal unit. An IG is a heterodimer composed of two heavy chains (IGH) and
two light chains bound by disulfide bridges. Each chain has two distinct parts: the variable domain in the N-
terminal side responsible for antigen recognition and the constant region on the C-terminal side. Three gene
families encode IGH variable domain: variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J). IGH sequences are created
during early B-cell ontogeny by a process called VDJ recombination or rearrangement, which randomly select
and joins together one of each of these three types of genes. Joining is imprecise as nucleotides are randomly
deleted and inserted in the V-D (N1) and D-J (N2) junctions. The N1-D-N2 region is called CDR3 and has
the highest variability.
After VDJ recombination, antigen-activated B cells undergo rapid proliferation (clone expansion) and
further diversification of their BCR by somatic hypermutation (SHM), an enzymatically-driven process in-
troducing point substitutions into the IG locus. The total collection of BCR-IGs in an individual tissue or
cell subset is referred to as the ‘immune repertoire’ (in short, repertoire) of the given cell population. The
repertoire of a human adult contains more than 10 11 BCR-IG sequences
