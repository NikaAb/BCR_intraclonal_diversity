Introduction


Context :

Effective response to the vast antigenic diversity of the microbial world is the main physiologic function of the immune system.
Membrane receptor of B-cells (BCR), one of the principal components of adaptive immunity, can recognize different and even closely related antigenes
their enormous inherent variability is achieved through genetic processes during B cell maturation; BCR genetic sequence composition can be used as an important identifier of a B cell clone which refers to a B cell of one specificity and its progeny.
Next generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the study of BCR  sequences and shed light on exploring the entire specific BCR’s in an individual or BCR repertoire.


The study of B-cell Clonal and intra-clonal diversity in the germinal center is an active field of research that can provide
an insight into the response to infections, mechanisms of vaccines, immunological memory, antibody
engineering, immunoproliferative diseases[], etc. But it still isn’t frequently used as a part of the
diagnosis or the follow-up routine in the clinical context.


Objectives :
The goal is to reconcile research-oriented Rep-Seq analyses with the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of
lymphocyte malignancies. Using an interactive visualization can encourage a
more regular usage of this information source.

The main aim was accomplished by fulfilling the following specific objectives: 
    1. Review the literature concerning the ...
    2. 
    3.




Contributions :
A draft of an accurate tool for visualizing repertoire up to intra-clonal diversity that could be used in the clinical context.




Work organization : 

A general content description of the subsequent chapters in this work is given as follows. 
The second chapter outlines genetic mechanisms that lead to high BCR repertoire diversity, particularly the VDJ recombination and somatic hypermutations
