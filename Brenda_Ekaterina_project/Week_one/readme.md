For the reflection document, please note that there are multiple sources of BCR variability : 

1. the combinatorial joining of IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ genes
2. the junctional diversity derived from exonuclease digestion and the insertion of non-templated bases at the IGHV-D and IGHD-J junctions
3. the pairing of heavy and light chains
4. the intra-clonal diversification provided by somatic hypermutation, causing point mutations and occasionally longer insertions or deletions in VDJ
rearrangements in antigen-experienced B cells.
