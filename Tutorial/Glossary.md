**AIRR format :** Standardized representations for annotated immune repertoires established by the Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire community of the Antibody society **[Reference AIRR]**.

**BCR lineage :** A constantly changing antigenic landscape implies constant modifications of the immune repertoire. Upon antigen recognition, B cells undergo somatic hyper- mutations, producing BCR sequence variants that share the same specificity but have different affinities. The collection of these sequences is known as the B Cell Receptor (BCR) lineage.
****

**BCR lineage tree :** a tree representing the evolutionary history of a BCR lineage. The root of the tree is the BCR sequence of the naive B cell giving rise to the lineage and other nodes are BCR sequence variants producing during the affinity maturation stage of the B-cell development.

**Clone** : a set of sequences that represent a B-cell lineage, that is, all progeny
of a given naive B cell. Sequences within a clone should have the same VDJ
rearrangement event, but they can vary due to their differences in the SHM
rate. This level gathers productive and unproductive sequences.

**Clonotype** : Since affinity selection is based on amino acid level, we based
our grouping criteria, at least partially, on the amino acid level. We used the IMGT definition that considers a clonotype as sequences with a unique V-(D)-J rearrangement, conserved anchors (C104, W or F 118), and a unique CDR3-IMGT AA in frame junction **[Reference IMGT clonotype]**.

**Unique nucleotide sequence** : group of identical sequences within a given
clonotype. Knowing that clonotype is defined at the amino acid level, dif-
ferent nucleotide sequences within a clonotype should pinpoint different
positions in BCR genotype landscapes.
